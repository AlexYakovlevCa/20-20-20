            When we use our eyes for near work, our focusing system can become fatigued. Our eyes can also dry out.
            Scheduling regular breaks can help to alleviate some of this strain.

            The 20-20-20 rule is easy to remember.
            For every 20 minutes of near work, look at a target 20 feet away for
            20 seconds. You can now return to your near activity.
